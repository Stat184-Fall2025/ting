## Overview

This repository contains my work for Activity #14 and Activity #15 (GitHub Practice).
It demonstrates basic GitHub version control skills, including branches, issues,
commits, and pull requests.

## Files

- `activity-14--2.pdf` – PDF I submitted for Activity #14.  
- `activity 14.qmd` – Quarto file used to create the PDF for Activity #14.  
- `PLAN.md` – Plan for creating/maintaining this repository and updating Activity #14.

## How to render the Quarto file

1. Open `activity 14.qmd` in RStudio.  
2. Click the **Render/Knit** button to create a PDF.  
3. The output should match `activity-14--2.pdf`.
