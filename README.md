## Overview

This repository contains my work for Activity #14 and Activity #15 (GitHub Practice).
It demonstrates basic GitHub version control skills, including branches, issues,
commits, and pull requests. This repository is part of STAT 184 at Penn State.

## Data sources

The data used in Activity #14 come from STAT 184 course materials, including:

- Armed forces pay grade / rank data used in Activities #08 and #10.

All data sets were provided by the instructor for use in this course.

## Current plan for the project

A detailed plan is written in `PLAN.md`. In summary:

- Keep this repository public and up to date.
- Maintain the Activity #14 QMD and PDF files.
- Use branches, commits, issues, and pull requests to manage any future changes
  to the report and code.
